### [Project Description](doc/project4_desc.md)

Have you ever wondered why Netflix continues to dominate the movie and TV streaming industry since it's inception in the late 90's? Most people think that Netflix is able to keep most of it's competition at bay because of it's exceptionally large collection of original content which competitors cannot match. Indeed, this is true. However, we would like to also highlight Netflix's marketing strategy as another of it's major strengths. Netflix makes use of targeted marketing that makes full use of collaborative filtering techniques to satisfy clients by availing tailored content that match clients' tastes. This boasts customer loyalty and also easily entices new users; hence Netflix's continued dominance.

**Project summary:** 

Inspired by the work done by the authors of the assigned papers below (who worked on improving Netflix's recommendation system), we implemented and compared the following content filtering methods as applied to the Netflix data:
	+ Alternative Least Squares with Temporal Dynamics regularization and KNN post processing
	+ Alternative Least Squares with Temporal Dynamics regularization and Kernel Ridge Regression post processing

**The assigned papers:**
